1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

ANSWER://

The following 3 main design advantages that object orientation presents is through 
abstraction/encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

    1) In encapsulation, sensitive tampering of values can be 
       eliminated with objects having the ability to hide certain parts of 
       themselves from programmers.
         -Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without
          including the background details or explanations.
         -Storing data and functions in a single unit(class) is encapsulation.

    2) Inheritance is the process by which objects can acquire the properties of 
       objects of other classes. Inheritance provides reusability, like, adding 
       additional features to an existing class without modifying it in supporting 
       legacy code and other tasks. (Polymorphism is extensively used in 
       implementing inheritance)

    3) Polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form. An operation may
       exhibit different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends on 
       the data types used in the operation. 

NOTE:// Due to larger applications being complex and challenging to code, object
        orientation forces programmers to plan and implement preventative/intensive
        planning process phases before beginning and having all design concepts
        already integrated to assure a solid foundation which will present less 
        errors down the road. Another beneficial characteristic of utilizing 
        object orientation is that once a program reaches a certain size, the 
        applications are easier to maintain and build upon in comparison with 
        applications that are non object oriented ones.

2. What is a class?

ANSWER:// "class object is a parent of all of its instance objects"-liz

A class is a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes 
and methods. (ex. dictionary)
   Class objects support two kinds of operations: 
    -attribute references 
    -instantiation

3. What is an instance attribute?

ANSWER://

An instance attribute is a variable defined in a class, in which each object
of the class has a separate copy, or instance. Instance attributes have notation 
of data unique to each instance and class variables, mentioned in the question/answer 
"2. What is a class?" above, are for attributes/methods shared by all instances
of the class.

4. What is a method?

ANSWER://

A method is a function that takes a class instance as its first parameter. 
    -Methods are members of classes and are bound or unbound.

    1) Bound methods belong to instances of a class.
    2) Unbound methods are called inside of a class instead of inside an instance.

5. What is an instance in object orientation?

ANSWER://

An instance in object orientation has to be aware of it's parent,(+properties)
so you have to pass the method that refers to the parent class as "self".

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.

ANSWER://

Class attributes are same for all instances of class whereas instance attributes
is particular for each instance. Also, instance attributes are for data specificied
for each instance, and class attributes are used by all instances of the class."""
